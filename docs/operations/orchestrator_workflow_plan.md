# Orchestrator Workflow Plan (Historical Snapshot)

Status: Historical planning note
Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This file captures an earlier workflow planning phase for the orchestrator.

The runtime has since expanded beyond this original plan, so this document is no
longer the active planning surface.

## Current Planning Sources

- `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md`
- `docs/operations/DOCUMENT_AUDIT.md`
- `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md`

## Why This File Still Exists

It still has historical value because it shows the earlier intended workflow
shape, but it should be read as background only.
