# Orchestrator Status (Historical Snapshot)

Status: Dated snapshot only
Snapshot date: 2026-02-19
Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This file records an older point-in-time status view of the orchestrator.

Because the runtime, task surface, and milestone pipeline have changed since
that snapshot, this file should not be used as the current operational status
source.

## Use These Instead

- `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md`
- `docs/OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/reference/task-types.md`
- `docs/reference/state-schema.md`
- `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md`

## Why This File Still Exists

It preserves a dated status checkpoint that may still be useful for historical
comparison.
