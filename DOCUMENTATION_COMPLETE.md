# Documentation Complete (Historical Snapshot)

Status: Historical milestone record
Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This file is preserved as evidence of an earlier documentation build-out phase.

It should not be treated as proof that the documentation is fully complete in
the current repo state. The docs continue to evolve with the runtime.

## Canonical Current Docs

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/NAVIGATION.md`
- `docs/operations/DOCUMENT_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md`

## Why This File Still Exists

It records a meaningful project milestone, but it is now a historical snapshot,
not an active status document.
