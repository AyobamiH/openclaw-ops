# Legacy Orchestrator Documentation

Status: Historical summary only
Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This file is retained as a legacy documentation snapshot.

It is no longer the canonical orchestrator reference because the active
first-party docs now live under `docs/` and the runtime has evolved beyond this
older summary.

## Use These Instead

- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/NAVIGATION.md`
- `docs/OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/reference/task-types.md`
- `docs/reference/state-schema.md`
- `docs/operations/DOCUMENT_AUDIT.md`

## Why This File Still Exists

It preserves an earlier summary of the orchestrator surface and may still be
useful as historical context, but it should not be used as the active source of
truth.
