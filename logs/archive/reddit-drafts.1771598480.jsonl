This isn&amp;#39;t about rewriting your app. It&amp;#39;s about finding the 5 or 6 things that are most likely to hurt you and fixing them before they become expensive problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The health check&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Is your app talking to the database efficiently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the number one performance killer I see in AI-generated code. The AI tends to make separate database calls inside loops instead of batching them. Your app might feel fast with 10 users. At 100 users it slows down. At 500 it starts timing out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What to look for: if your app loads a page and you can see it making dozens of small database requests instead of a few larger ones, that&amp;#39;s the problem. This is sometimes called the &amp;quot;N+1 query problem&amp;quot; if you want to Google it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fix is usually straightforward. Batch your queries. Load related data together instead of one at a time. This alone can make your app 5 to 10 times faster without changing anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Are your API keys and secrets actually secure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still see apps where API keys are hardcoded directly in the frontend code. That means anyone who opens their browser&amp;#39;s developer tools can see your Stripe key, your OpenAI key, whatever you&amp;#39;ve got in there. That&amp;#39;s not a minor issue. Someone could run up thousands of dollars on your OpenAI account or worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What to check: open your app in a browser, right-click, hit &amp;quot;View Page Source&amp;quot; or check the Network tab. If you can see any API keys in there, they need to move to your backend immediately. Your frontend should never talk directly to third-party APIs. It should go through your own backend which keeps the keys hidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re on Lovable, use Lovable Secrets for your environment variables. If you&amp;#39;ve migrated to Railway or another host, use their environment variable settings. Never commit keys to your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What happens when something fails?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try this: turn off your Wifi and use your app. Or open it in an incognito window and try to access a page that requires login. What happens?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most AI-generated apps, the answer is nothing good. You get a blank screen, a cryptic error, or the app just hangs. Your users are seeing this too. They just aren&amp;#39;t telling you about it. They&amp;#39;re leaving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good error handling means: if a payment fails, the user sees a clear message and can retry. If the server is slow, there&amp;#39;s a loading state instead of a frozen screen. If someone&amp;#39;s session expires, they get redirected to login instead of seeing broken data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t need to be perfect. But the critical flows, signup, login, payment, and whatever your core feature is, should fail gracefully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Do you have any test coverage on your payment flow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your app charges money, this is non-negotiable. I&amp;#39;ve worked with founders who didn&amp;#39;t realize their Stripe integration was silently failing for days. Revenue was leaking and they had no idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At minimum you want: a test that confirms a user can complete a purchase end to end, a test that confirms failed payments are handled properly, and a test that confirms webhooks from Stripe are being received and processed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not sure how to write these, even a manual checklist that you run through before every deployment helps. Go to your staging environment (you have one, right?), make a test purchase with Stripe&amp;#39;s test card, and confirm everything works. Every single time before you push to production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Is there any separation between your staging and production environments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re pushing code changes directly to the app your customers are using, you&amp;#39;re one bad commit away from breaking everything. I covered this in detail in my last post about the MVP to production workflow, but it&amp;#39;s worth repeating because it&amp;#39;s still the most common gap I see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staging doesn&amp;#39;t need to be complicated. It&amp;#39;s just a second copy of your app that runs your new code before real users see it. Railway makes this easy. Vercel makes this easy. Even a second Lovable deployment can work in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point is: never let your customers be the first people to test your changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Can your app handle 10x your current users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to over-engineer for millions of users. But you should know what breaks first when traffic increases. Usually it&amp;#39;s the database queries (see point 1), large file uploads with no size limits, or API rate limits you haven&amp;#39;t accounted for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A simple way to think about it: if your app has 50 users right now and someone shares it on Twitter tomorrow and 500 people sign up, what breaks? If you don&amp;#39;t know the answer, that&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;What I&amp;#39;d actually prioritize&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking at this list and feeling overwhelmed, don&amp;#39;t try to fix everything at once. Here&amp;#39;s the order I&amp;#39;d tackle it in:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, secure your API keys. This is a safety issue, not a performance issue. Do it today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, set up staging if you don&amp;#39;t have one. This protects you from yourself going forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, add error handling to your payment flow and test it manually before every deploy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, fix your database queries if your app is starting to feel slow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fifth and sixth can wait until you&amp;#39;re actively scaling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of these fixes take a few hours each, not weeks. And they&amp;#39;re the difference between an app that can grow and an app that falls apart the moment it starts getting attention. You can even use services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getvibecodingcoach.com/&quot;&gt;Vibe Coach&lt;/a&gt; or hire a software engineer on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upwork.com/&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt; to do it for you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still on Lovable and not planning to migrate, most of this still applies. The principles are the same regardless of where your app lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know if you need any help. If you&amp;#39;ve already gone through some of this, I&amp;#39;d genuinely be curious to hear what you found in your own codebase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ebb_and_flow33&quot;&gt; /u/ebb_and_flow33 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/","author":"/u/ebb_and_flow33","matchedKeywords":["stripe","webhook","environment variables"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about The &quot;your app works but your code is a mess&quot; checklist I run on every Lovable app before scaling.

It’s grown into a pretty complex product, with multiple systems, integrations, subscriptions, and workflows. The codebase now sits at over 2 million lines generated through the platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not a traditional developer. I didn’t come from a computer science background. Lovable allowed me to turn an idea into something real, and I’ve poured an enormous amount of time into learning, iterating, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly making it work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently I met with a developer because I wanted advice about scaling and doing things properly long term. The conversation kind of threw me off. He kept saying things like “Lovable can’t replace engineers,” which I actually agree with. That was never my expectation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the tone felt dismissive, almost like the work didn’t really count because it was built with AI tools. He asked a lot about revenue and investors, and when I said the platform is subscription based and currently funded by myself, with some help from my dad, the energy shifted. It felt like I had failed some unspoken test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What confused me is that another developer I spoke to afterwards had the complete opposite reaction. He was genuinely impressed that something this complex could be built using Lovable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now I’m curious:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do reactions to Lovable vary so much among developers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it skepticism about maintainability? Concern about technical debt? General resistance to AI assisted development? Or am I just misreading the situation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to replace engineers. I fully expect I will need experienced developers as the product grows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think I just walked away from that meeting feeling strangely discouraged after months of hard work, like building something real didn’t carry the same weight because of how it was built.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear how others here have experienced this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ConfidentWelcome9282&quot;&gt; /u/ConfidentWelcome9282 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/","author":"/u/ConfidentWelcome9282","matchedKeywords":["subscription","technical debt"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":2,"export_quality_shock":3},"totalScore":5,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Built a complex platform with Lovable and left a developer meeting feeling discouraged.

Looking for a little advice on if this is something I could do in Lovable with minimal &amp;quot;try to add something, break 3 other things&amp;quot; instances or if I should be looking at another platform or hiring someone. Years ago I had looked at upwork and fiverr etc and been quoted $10-15k&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Im looking at building a web portal where customers purchase digital streaming assets through Shopify. These are media file URLs that users paste into OBS or other livestreaming platforms as “Internet Media Sources. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a purchase, users should log into the account portion of my site and see a gallery of only the products they own. Each product contains 3 to10 media links that rotate every couple of weeks to reduce piracy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I need user authentication, Shopify purchase syncing, link rotation logic, and an admin panel to manage products and users. I’m trying to determine if Lovable can handle this (possibly with Supabase or Make), or if I need a different architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Months ago I tested lovable for this and it was fun creating a simple UX for it but at that point there was no shopify syncing. Now that Shopify has an integration, I am hoping I can get this moving. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have VERY little actual programming knowledge but I am technical and can learn quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I currently have a successful shopify store doing this but I want to upgrade my product to the 2.0 version ive been dreaming of. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;User Purchase Product A with their email address at checkout.&lt;br/&gt; They then create an account on the lovable website using the same email address&lt;br/&gt; They login, hit &amp;quot;my products&amp;quot; and see Product A&lt;br/&gt; They click Product A and a window pops up with the links they need to copy and paste&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/epicoptimist&quot;&gt; /u/epicoptimist &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/","author":"/u/epicoptimist","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","checkout"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Looking for advice on feasibility of my project.

{"draftId":"8f4fad8b-3a44-4558-8b87-e4d10670d0a0","pillar":"lovable","feedId":"r_supabase","subreddit":"Supabase","title":"I built Nuvix after using Supabase for a while","content":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m the developer behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nuvix-dev/nuvix&quot;&gt;Nuvix&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. I built it after using Supabase extensively, because I kept running into certain limitations or tedious setups (especially around permissions, storage, and integrations). Nuvix is an open-source, self-hostable backend (think auth, database, storage, messaging all in one API). I’m not here to hype it, just to share how it works under the hood and see if these ideas would address any pain points you’ve had with Supabase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Permissions and Database Schemas&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase is essentially a hosted PostgreSQL with RLS. You get a single Postgres schema (by default &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;) and you enable Row-Level Security (RLS) policies manually on your tables if you need security. In practice that means &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; write SQL policies (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE … ENABLE RLS; CREATE POLICY … USING (...)&lt;/code&gt;) to control who can see what. Nuvix takes a different approach: it has &lt;strong&gt;three schema modes&lt;/strong&gt; so you can pick how strict or flexible you want to be. Concretely, Nuvix has:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document&lt;/strong&gt; – for rapid prototyping (Appwrite-like): a NoSQL-style table where you don’t write SQL and permissions are manual.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managed&lt;/strong&gt; – for production apps: tables are auto-generated with CRUD endpoints, and Nuvix auto-creates RLS policies and permission tables (so the data is “secure by default”).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanaged&lt;/strong&gt; – full SQL power: you define your own tables/views and write raw Postgres queries, with no built-in restrictions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;These share one unified API. The key is “secure by default”: every request (db query, file action, etc.) goes through Nuvix’s permission checks. In Supabase, the default is more relaxed (you have to turn on RLS per table and write the policies yourself). In Nuvix, I’ve tried to bake in a zero-trust model (managed schemas auto-enable RLS so you don’t forget). Of course Supabase is more mature here – its RLS system is powerful and flexible once you know SQL, and you can disable it on a table if you need a quick hack. Nuvix trades some of that raw flexibility for easier, safer defaults when you need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Storage and Uploads&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase storage is S3-compatible buckets with a separate API client. By default you get a bucket where anyone with a signed URL can upload/download, and you manage bucket-level policies. Large uploads (&amp;gt;6MB) require using Supabase’s &lt;strong&gt;Resumable/TUS&lt;/strong&gt; protocol client. In other words, for big files you often end up using a library like &lt;code&gt;tus-js-client&lt;/code&gt; and hitting a special resumable endpoint. It works fine, but it’s a bit indirect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuvix’s storage is more tightly integrated with the database permissions. Under the hood you can plug in S3 or even local disk, but every file has the same RLS-like rules as your data (so a user only accesses files they’re allowed to). The Nuvix SDK also has &lt;strong&gt;chunked/resumable uploads built in&lt;/strong&gt; – you don’t need a separate TUS client or to manage multipart manually (the SDK handles splitting and retry). In practice it means I can do &lt;code&gt;nuvix.uploadFile(...)&lt;/code&gt; on a big file and get progress callbacks, and the server stitches the pieces together. Supabase can do similar things with TUS (6MB chunks by default), but Nuvix tries to make it seamless out of the box.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The storage philosophies differ: Supabase leans on S3 and a straightforward REST bucket model (you can also generate signed URLs to bypass Supabase altogether). Nuvix treats the file store as a “permission-aware file system” – essentially an API layer on top of S3/local that checks RLS rules. The trade-off is complexity vs convenience: Supabase’s way is simpler (and battle-tested at scale), whereas Nuvix’s way aims for uniform security (but is newer code).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Messaging and Integrations&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One big gap I felt in Supabase was messaging. Supabase provides email for user auth out-of-the-box (via GoTrue), but if you want SMS, push notifications, or anything fancy, you have to connect external services yourself. For example, many people wire up OneSignal or Firebase in an Edge Function to send push/SMS/email when a DB event happens. That’s flexible, but it’s extra work per channel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuvix decided to include messaging APIs natively. You can send &lt;strong&gt;email, SMS, or push&lt;/strong&gt; through one simple interface. We have templates and scheduling baked in so you can do things like “send verification SMS” without wiring Twilio or a separate mail server (you still need your own Twilio/SendGrid keys configured, but Nuvix handles the rest). The upside is convenience: one API call covers multiple channels. The downside is that Nuvix’s integrations are fewer today – you’re tied to whatever providers we support (Twilio, SendGrid, etc.) in the Nuvix config. Supabase’s model is more DIY but infinitely flexible (you can use any service via edge functions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;SDK and Developer Experience&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase’s JavaScript client (&lt;code&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/code&gt;) is great and strongly typed, but it still feels like a thin veneer over multiple services (supabase.auth.goTrue, supabase.from(table), supabase.storage.from(bucket), etc.). Nuvix exposes a single &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;const nx = new Client({projectId, endpoint})&lt;/code&gt;) and everything (auth, db, storage, messaging) lives on that object with consistent naming. We focused on making the APIs &lt;strong&gt;type-safe and discoverable&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, fetching data, uploading a file, and sending an email use similar patterns and all benefit from autocompletion. We don’t offer GraphQL yet, so it’s REST/JSON only (though we support nested filters and joins in clever ways, aiming to be easier than raw PostgREST).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Supabase uses PostgREST for the DB, Kong/gotrue for auth, and so on, whereas Nuvix is one Node/Bun service with an integrated metadata layer (we build the API endpoints ourselves). Supabase’s SDK also has built-in real-time subscriptions (via Realtime or Postgres listen), which Nuvix doesn’t have yet. We trade some of that maturity for a unified model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hosting and Flexibility&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase’s main draw is the hosted experience: you can sign up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://supabase.com&quot;&gt;supabase.com&lt;/a&gt; and get a DB+auth+storage without setup. They also offer a Docker-based self-host if you want control. Nuvix is built to be &lt;strong&gt;self-hosted first&lt;/strong&gt;: we ship a Docker Compose that you can run anywhere, and your data lives wherever you choose. It’s also multi-tenant: one Nuvix server can host multiple projects (each with its own schema isolation), whereas Supabase is typically “one database per project.” For a SaaS builder, that means fewer servers/dbs to manage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trade-off: Supabase’s hosting is polished and scalable (and supports a multi-region edge network, etc.), while Nuvix gives you complete ownership and easy on-prem deployment. Supabase has the edge on enterprise readiness (performance scaling, analytics, native GraphQL, vector search), but Nuvix prioritizes giving you direct control and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Where Supabase Excels (and Nuvix is New)&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase is a mature ecosystem. It has a polished dashboard, a ton of examples, and features like auto-generated GraphQL, Edge Functions, and vector DBs. If you hit a common problem, there’s likely a guide or NPM package for it. Nuvix is brand new (just hit 1.0). It doesn’t have all those extensions yet, and the community is small. Supabase’s approach is also a bit more incremental (add what you need, skip what you don’t) while Nuvix tries to do “everything in one place.” That means some opinions baked in, which may not fit every use-case out of the box.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Where Nuvix Takes a Different Path&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Nuvix I tried to solve pain points I had with Supabase. One was the repetitive work of setting up RLS everywhere – Nuvix makes security the default . Another was the friction of multiple services (auth here, storage there, messaging over there) – Nuvix provides one coherent stack (e.g. one SDK, one dashboard). The three-schema model was designed to support both rapid NoSQL-style development and structured relational workflows, depending on the use case. I also built chunked upload and unified permissions in the core so you don’t have to wire those in manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously Nuvix is opinionated and has less polish (and fewer community integrations) right now. But I wanted to spark a discussion about whether these trade-offs are worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really curious:&lt;/strong&gt; for all of you who’ve built stuff on Supabase, have you hit problems that any of these design choices would solve? Would auto-RLS schemas, built-in chunked uploads, and a single messaging API make your life easier, or would you prefer the flexibility Supabase currently offers? I’d love honest feedback from the Supabase community, not as a pitch but as a genuine question about developer trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Mail-587&quot;&gt; /u/Illustrious-Mail-587 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/","author":"/u/Illustrious-Mail-587","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","subscription","schema"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":8},"totalScore":8,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about I built Nuvix after using Supabase for a while.

Thanks for input!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started my project with Supabase a few years ago with a web app and a backend service (Next.js route handlers, functions). I leaned heavily on RLS and input validation via triggers as recommended by Supabase, but struggled with some practical aspects:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sometimes a user should see an aggregation (e.g. sum, average), but not the actual rows. So I ended up with overly permissive policies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I use TypeScript libs for complex schema validation in the browser and in the backend, but I&amp;#39;d need to re-implement these rules via SQL. So I skipped that and settled for some basic rules.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PL/pgSQL is very cumbersome when it comes to implementing and maintaining complex logic in a modular way, especially compared to modern languages like TypeScript.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this permissive approach, any authenticated user could bypass the backend entirely and read/write the database directly, skipping backend-defined schema checks and visibility rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fix: a RESTRICTIVE RLS policy on every table that requires a server-side API key. The key lives in Vault. Only our backend service sends it, browsers don&amp;#39;t know it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql CREATE FUNCTION rbac.is_server_request() RETURNS boolean LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER AS $$ SELECT coalesce( current_setting(&amp;#39;request.headers&amp;#39;, true)::json-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;#39;x-api-key&amp;#39; = (SELECT decrypted_secret FROM vault.decrypted_secrets WHERE name = &amp;#39;postgrest_api_key&amp;#39;), false); $$; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql -- Added to every public table CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Require server request&amp;quot; ON my_table AS RESTRICTIVE FOR ALL USING (rbac.is_server_request()); &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because RESTRICTIVE policies are AND-ed with PERMISSIVE ones, no request gets through without the key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A pgTAP test in CI catches any new table missing the policy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql SELECT is( (SELECT array_agg(t.tablename) FROM pg_tables t WHERE t.schemaname = &amp;#39;public&amp;#39; AND t.rowsecurity = true AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies p WHERE p.tablename = t.tablename AND p.policyname = &amp;#39;Require server request&amp;#39; AND p.permissive = &amp;#39;RESTRICTIVE&amp;#39;)), NULL, &amp;#39;All tables must have the restrictive server request policy&amp;#39;); &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your feedback -- especially if you know a simpler way to achieve this or if you see a flaw in this approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Estimate-362&quot;&gt; /u/No-Estimate-362 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/","author":"/u/No-Estimate-362","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","schema"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about How to prevent client-side access to PostgREST API.

This update is probably most relevant for the devs in the crowd, so if you’re already familiar with agents, scroll down a bit. But if you’re unfamiliar with agents: agents are AI-powered programs that can make decisions and execute actions autonomously. They can run a deep research query or build an entire application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that out of the way, here’s the meatier info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re launching a preview of machine payments on Stripe. This will allow developers to directly charge autonomous agents using just a few lines of code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autonomous agents, being an entirely new category of users to build for and sell to, are acting on behalf of buyers in a financial system that is not set up for them. They require:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;microtransactions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;24/7 global rails&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;controls (for human out of the loop)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;low latency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;http native&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;finality guarantees &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with this update, businesses can accept machine payments via Stripe PaymentIntents API. They can charge agents for API usage, MCP calls, or HTTP requests with agent-specific pricing plans, in addition to conventional monetization using subscriptions and invoices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a PaymentIntent&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stripe generates a unique deposit address per transaction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Return the address to the agent and instruct it to send funds or a payment token&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Track transaction status via API, webhook, or Dashboard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Money lands in your default balance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re launching with support for x402 using USDC stablecoins on Base, with more protocols, payment methods, currencies, and chains to come. And sales tax, refunds, and reporting just work. (only think about crypto if you actually want to) &lt;em&gt;If you have thoughts on what we should prioritize regarding what’s to come for machine payments, please let us know in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re also releasing an open source cli called purl for you (+ bot friends) to test machine payments in the terminal, along with Node and Python samples.

Don’t","content":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was ignoring it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept of skills kinda flew over my head. I thought you just tell your agent how to behave and save those rules and then life goes on, it gets smarter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then my agent told me my agents.md overflowed by a few hundred characters. It was over 20k characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I asked if it was good if she had all the rules and things we talked about in there. She took some time to respond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I then started this conversation with opus via claude chat and found out that your bootstrap files, like agents.md and soul.md are files that load on every single message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So of course all the rule I had been giving her in those files had been bogging her down, and she couldnt help me as well as I wanted her to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was frustrated but found the reason. With opus, we removed all the fluff and reduced her bootstrap file character count by 73% while maintaining the substance that was her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We then moved all our “rules” into organized skills. We now have a skill builder skill that allows us to build custom skills for ourselves. And we made a bunch. We only downloaded one skill from clawhub, and there are so many great pre built skills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What cool is these dont load on every message. The list of tools load for her and she can choose which to use based on my request. So now I am saving a good amount on each message. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was obviously how it was always supposed to work. No more burning tokens and needing to upgrade plans. I am not sure how I could have found out about this earlier… i need to do better. We do. If you didn’t set up skills like this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see people mentioning stuff and I didnt dive in deep enough, and it cost me money, energy and time. I am the type of guy that just wants to go instead of reading the manual, but dang I coulda had it easier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many wont figure this out and will give up on the current openclaw when we have everything that we need already. I also probably need to join that help discord that the mod keeps spamming. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/frogchungus&quot;&gt; /u/frogchungus &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/clawdbot/comments/1r9keb7/are_you_ignoring_skills_dont/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/clawdbot/comments/1r9keb7/are_you_ignoring_skills_dont/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/clawdbot/comments/1r9keb7/are_you_ignoring_skills_dont/","author":"/u/frogchungus","matchedKeywords":["skill","skills","claude"],"scoreBreakdown":{"skills_supply_chain":4,"hardening_and_runtime":1},"totalScore":5,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Are you ignoring skills?

{"draftId":"931ff009-e9e2-4b20-a2a6-7a259715c851","pillar":"openclaw","feedId":"r_clawdbot","subreddit":"clawdbot","title":"📌 r/clawdbot FAQ — Read this before posting!","content":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/clawdbot&quot;&gt;r/clawdbot&lt;/a&gt; FAQ&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;🚀 Setup &amp;amp; Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I install OpenClaw? I&amp;#39;m not technical.&lt;/strong&gt; OpenClaw runs on any computer — Mac, Linux, Windows (via WSL2), Raspberry Pi, or a cheap VPS ($5/month). Full guide at &lt;a href=&quot;https://openclaw.ai&quot;&gt;openclaw.ai&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&amp;#39;t want to manage a server, hosted options like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lobsterlair.xyz&quot;&gt;Lobsterlair&lt;/a&gt; handle everything for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Terminal? Really? Can&amp;#39;t it just be an app?&lt;/strong&gt; OpenClaw is a CLI tool by design — it&amp;#39;s what makes it powerful and flexible. There&amp;#39;s a Mac app in development, but the terminal setup takes 5 minutes and the docs walk you through every step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: My bot won&amp;#39;t start / &amp;quot;Disconnected (4008): Auth failed&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; This usually means your API key or OAuth token expired. Run &lt;code&gt;openclaw status&lt;/code&gt; to check. If using Anthropic: regenerate your API key at console.anthropic.com. If using OAuth: re-authenticate with &lt;code&gt;openclaw auth login&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: My bot keeps going offline / ISP issues&lt;/strong&gt; If your ISP gives you a dynamic IP or drops connections, consider: 1) Running on a VPS instead of your home machine, 2) Using a hosted service like Lobsterlair, 3) Setting up a process manager (systemd/launchd) to auto-restart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How long does it take for the bot to respond?&lt;/strong&gt; First message after startup takes 10-30 seconds (model loading). After that, simple messages: 5-15 seconds. Complex tasks with tools: 30-120 seconds. If it&amp;#39;s consistently slow, check your model provider&amp;#39;s status page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;💰 Models &amp;amp; Costs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Which LLM model is best for price/quality?&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Best quality:&lt;/strong&gt; Claude Opus 4.6 (expensive, ~$15/M input tokens) - &lt;strong&gt;Best balance:&lt;/strong&gt; Claude Sonnet 4.5 (good quality, ~$3/M input tokens)&lt;br/&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; Gemini 2.5 Flash or local models via Ollama (free but less capable) - &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a cheaper model for routine tasks and switch to Opus for complex work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: I burned through my tokens immediately! How do I control costs?&lt;/strong&gt; Set spending limits in your provider dashboard. Use &lt;code&gt;session_status&lt;/code&gt; to monitor usage. Consider: 1) Using a cheaper model as default, 2) Reducing heartbeat frequency, 3) Keeping context windows small by resetting sessions regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is using OpenClaw with a ChatGPT Plus / Claude Pro subscription allowed?&lt;/strong&gt; This is a gray area. Check each provider&amp;#39;s ToS. Anthropic&amp;#39;s docs say OAuth tokens from Pro/Max plans should only be used with Claude Code and Claude.ai. Using API keys (pay-per-token) is the safe route. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance&quot;&gt;Anthropic&amp;#39;s legal docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I use Ollama / local models to save money?&lt;/strong&gt; Install Ollama, pull a model (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ollama pull llama3&lt;/code&gt;), then configure OpenClaw to point at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:11434&lt;/code&gt;. Works great for simple tasks, but complex tool use is better with Claude/GPT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;🔧 Common Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: OpenClaw keeps forgetting things between sessions&lt;/strong&gt; OpenClaw starts fresh each session. Use MEMORY.md and memory/ files to persist important context. Write things down — &amp;quot;mental notes&amp;quot; don&amp;#39;t survive restarts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Context limit exceeded / conversation reset&lt;/strong&gt; Long conversations hit the model&amp;#39;s context window. This is normal. Tips: 1) Start new sessions for new topics, 2) Keep MEMORY.md concise, 3) Use subagents for isolated tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Subagents return 404 after updating&lt;/strong&gt; Check if your model is still available on your provider. After updates, model aliases sometimes change. Run &lt;code&gt;openclaw status&lt;/code&gt; and verify your config.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &amp;quot;Unknown Model&amp;quot; error&lt;/strong&gt; Your configured model isn&amp;#39;t available on your provider. Check model name spelling, verify your API key has access to that model, and check if the model was renamed or deprecated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;🛡️ Security &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I secure my OpenClaw instance?&lt;/strong&gt; - Never expose your gateway port to the internet - Use API keys, not OAuth tokens embedded in scripts - Set up rate limits and spending caps - Use Telegram/Discord as your only entry point (small attack surface) - Review what tools and permissions your agent has&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Has anyone been banned by Anthropic for using OpenClaw?&lt;/strong&gt; No confirmed bans for normal usage. However, using Pro/Max OAuth tokens in third-party tools may violate ToS. Safest approach: use API keys with pay-per-token billing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;🤖 Skills &amp;amp; Automation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What can OpenClaw actually do?&lt;/strong&gt; Anything a human can do at a computer: manage emails, monitor servers, post on social media, research topics, write code, manage files, control smart home devices, scrape websites, and more. It&amp;#39;s limited by the skills/tools you give it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How do I install skills from ClawHub?&lt;/strong&gt; Run &lt;code&gt;clawhub search &amp;quot;keyword&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to find skills, then &lt;code&gt;clawhub install skill-name&lt;/code&gt;. Your agent can also install skills on its own if you ask it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can my agent post to social media automatically?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes — via browser automation (profile=openclaw) or platform APIs. For TikTok, tools like Postiz can help. For X/Twitter, the agent can use the browser directly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;💡 Getting the Most Out of OpenClaw&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What&amp;#39;s the best way to set up my agent?&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Write a good SOUL.md (personality, rules, boundaries) 2. Write USER.md (who you are, what you need) 3. Set up MEMORY.md for persistence between sessions 4. Start simple — add complexity over time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: My agent&amp;#39;s responses are generic / not helpful&lt;/strong&gt; Invest time in your SOUL.md and give it context about you and your workflow. The more specific your instructions, the better the output. Also consider upgrading to a better model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This FAQ is maintained by the community.

Roast it.","content":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I got frustrated watching people either fail to get OpenClaw running or — worse — get it running completely exposed and not realize what they&amp;#39;d just handed to the internet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://crosshilldesign.com/openclaw&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; I wish had existed when I started. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a full end-to-end walkthrough for self-hosting on AWS EC2 and connecting it to Discord. Not &amp;quot;here&amp;#39;s a command, good luck&amp;quot; — every step is explained, every decision has a reason, and the security hardening is real, not decorative. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s covered: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- AWS EC2 setup from scratch (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS — I explain why not 24.04)&lt;br/&gt; - Full server hardening: custom SSH port, key-only auth, UFW, fail2ban&lt;br/&gt; - Docker install with swap file (t3.small users: you need this)&lt;br/&gt; - Complete OpenClaw install including the ChatGPT OAuth flow that trips everyone up — specifically the &amp;quot;page won&amp;#39;t load but that&amp;#39;s correct, copy the localhost URL&amp;quot; moment that I had to figure out the hard way&lt;br/&gt; - Discord bot setup step by step — Developer Portal, intents (all three explained and why), OAuth invite, DM setup, the whole thing&lt;br/&gt; - A dedicated prompt injection section because I don&amp;#39;t think most people running OpenClaw right now understand what they&amp;#39;ve actually exposed. I cite the Giskard research, the Kaspersky writeup, the Sophos &amp;quot;lethal trifecta&amp;quot; framing. It&amp;#39;s not meant to scare people off, it&amp;#39;s meant to actually help them understand the threat model.&lt;br/&gt; - A &amp;quot;Now What&amp;quot; section covering where to go from here — multi-LLM routing, token optimization, memory file structure, etc., tutorials i am looking to build out in the future as I continue to tinker and learn. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;#39;m specifically proud of: I don&amp;#39;t sugarcoat the danger. The intro has a whole section that&amp;#39;s basically &amp;quot;this thing can leak credentials you never want leaked, delete things you can&amp;#39;t get back, and cost you real money if someone finds your exposed instance — and you probably don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;re doing yet, which is fine, but here&amp;#39;s why that matters.&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;ve seen too many people in the community get burned because the hype content never mentioned any of that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy to get ripped apart. Specifically looking for: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;- Anything I got technically wrong&lt;br/&gt; - Steps that are unclear or assume too much&lt;br/&gt; - Anything the security section missed or got wrong &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://crosshilldesign.com/openclaw&quot;&gt;crosshilldesign.com/openclaw&lt;/a&gt; — it&amp;#39;s a full single-page tutorial, no login, no email capture, no BS. Just the guide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last thing worth saying clearly: this is not a &amp;quot;use OpenClaw to make $10k a month&amp;quot; tutorial. It&amp;#39;s not an advanced power-user guide. It&amp;#39;s specifically built for someone who&amp;#39;s been reading all the hype, isn&amp;#39;t super technical, and wants to actually try this thing out without bricking their laptop, exposing their life to the internet, or getting an unexpected AWS bill. I wanted to give that person a safe, cheap, working starting point — AWS free tier, ChatGPT Pro they probably already have, and a Discord they definitely already have. That&amp;#39;s it. Get it running safely, see what it can actually do, and go from there.

When i was accessing these services in Brave browser, everything was reachable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then i decided to check on phone of my girlfriend and to my surprise everything was working flawlesly.

Too tired to do a proper writeup, so I will give some bullet points and a disclaimer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;27 New eval results added in total&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Got our first 4 community submissions, which brings us GPT 5.3 Codex Spark results, and a few Droid + Skills results to show us how big of a difference a suitable skills file can make.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3 New OSS coding agents; kilocode cli, cline cli, and pi*&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Some site UI improvements, like date slider filter, being able to expand the filter options window, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interesting pattern I realized. GPT-codex models do really well cause they like to iterate, a lot. These kinds of evals favor models with this kind of tendency. Claude models don&amp;#39;t iterate as much, so they sometimes get edged out in these kinds of evals. In an actual interactive coding scenario, I do believe the claude models are still better. Now if you want to just assign a long running task and forget it, that&amp;#39;s where the gpt-codex models shine. They just keep going and going until done, they&amp;#39;re good at that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A somewhat important note, the infra used makes a HUGE difference in scores. I noticed this very early on, back when I used to run a ton of terminal bench evals, and especially when I decided to run it against as many different providers as I could to see which one was the best for Kimi K2 thinking. Even the speed affected scores a lot. My bench is no different in this regard, although I tried my best to work around this by having generous retry limits, and manually vetting every run for infra issues (which probably takes up the majority of my time), and rerunning any evals that looked like they may have suffered infra issues. This however isn&amp;#39;t perfect, I am human. The reason I mention this is cause &lt;a href=&quot;http://z.ai&quot;&gt;z.ai&lt;/a&gt; infra is dying. It made it almost impossible to bench against the official api. It was actually more expensive to use than paying standard api rates to claude for opus lol. They ghosted after I asked if I could have credits back for the wasted tokens I never got.. but that&amp;#39;s neither here nor there. And also you might see some of the same models but from different providers score differently for infra reasons. Even the date of eval might matter for this, since sometimes providers change, either improving and fixing things, or otherwise. Also worth noting since some runs are older than others, some things might not score as well, being on an older agent version. Hopefully the filter by date slider I added can help with this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*Pi was a large part of why this took me so much time and reruns. The retry logic had to be changed cause it&amp;#39;s the only agent that does not have streaming stdout for some reason, and buffers it all until it&amp;#39;s done. It also has 0 iteration whatsoever, it just does everything on one shot and never iterates on it again, leading to very poor scores. No other agents behave like this. These changes introduced bugs, which meant a lot of time spent fixing things and having to rerun things for fair evals. Pi I think is really cool, but since it&amp;#39;s headless mode or whatever you want to call it is only a half complete implementation at best, it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to get a fair evaluation of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/lemon07r&quot;&gt; /u/lemon07r &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r9ours/qwen35_plus_glm_5_gemini_31_pro_sonnet_46_three/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r9ours/qwen35_plus_glm_5_gemini_31_pro_sonnet_46_three/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r9ours/qwen35_plus_glm_5_gemini_31_pro_sonnet_46_three/","author":"/u/lemon07r","matchedKeywords":["skill","skills","qwen","claude"],"scoreBreakdown":{"skills_supply_chain":4,"hardening_and_runtime":2},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Qwen3.5 Plus, GLM 5, Gemini 3.1 Pro, Sonnet 4.6, three new open source agents, and a lot more added to SanityBoard.

Here&amp;#39;s exactly how I did it so you can too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total cost: &lt;strong&gt;~$7.60/month&lt;/strong&gt; for the server + whatever AI model you use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 1: Create the Server&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hetzner.com/&quot;&gt;hetzner.com&lt;/a&gt;, sign up, go to the cloud console.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;New Project&lt;/strong&gt;, name it &amp;quot;openclaw&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Add Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Location: closest to you&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Image: &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu 24.04&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Type: &lt;strong&gt;Shared Resources &amp;gt; Regular Performance &amp;gt; CPX22&lt;/strong&gt; ($6.99/month)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Networking: keep &lt;strong&gt;Public IPv4&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;IPv6&lt;/strong&gt; both checked&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need an SSH key. On your laptop:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh-keygen -t ed25519 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enter through everything. Then:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copy the whole output, paste it into the Hetzner SSH Key field. Skip everything else (Volumes, Firewalls, Backups, etc). Name it, create it, copy the &lt;strong&gt;IP address&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 2: Connect&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Type &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; at the fingerprint prompt.

Add &lt;code&gt;network_mode: host&lt;/code&gt; and DELETE the entire &lt;code&gt;ports:&lt;/code&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;network_mode: host &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Docker&amp;#39;s default bridge networking changes source IPs which breaks device pairing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change 3&lt;/strong&gt; — Add environment variables:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;NODE_ENV: production OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND:-loopback} OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT:-18789} OPENCLAW_SECRET: ${OPENCLAW_SECRET} XDG_CONFIG_HOME: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change 4&lt;/strong&gt; — Remove Anthropic keys. Delete these from both services if present:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CLAUDE_AI_SESSION_KEY CLAUDE_WEB_SESSION_KEY CLAUDE_WEB_COOKIE &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change 5&lt;/strong&gt; — Add restart policy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;restart: unless-stopped &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the gateway restarts on crash or reboot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;9c. The complete file&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Easiest: replace the whole thing. Delete everything (&lt;code&gt;Ctrl+K&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly) and paste:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;services: openclaw-gateway: image: ${OPENCLAW_IMAGE:-openclaw:local} build: . environment: HOME: /home/node TERM: xterm-256color OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN} NODE_ENV: production OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND:-loopback} OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT:-18789} OPENCLAW_SECRET: ${OPENCLAW_SECRET} XDG_CONFIG_HOME: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME} volumes: - ${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR}:/home/node/.openclaw - ${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR}:/home/node/.openclaw/workspace network_mode: host init: true restart: unless-stopped command: [&amp;quot;node&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dist/index.js&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gateway&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--bind&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_BIND:-loopback}&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--port&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;18789&amp;quot;] openclaw-cli: image: ${OPENCLAW_IMAGE:-openclaw:local} environment: HOME: /home/node TERM: xterm-256color OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN} BROWSER: echo volumes: - ${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_DIR}:/home/node/.openclaw - ${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR}:/home/node/.openclaw/workspace stdin_open: true tty: true init: true entrypoint: [&amp;quot;node&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;dist/index.js&amp;quot;] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 10: Modify the Dockerfile&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenClaw&amp;#39;s Dockerfile has a &lt;code&gt;USER node&lt;/code&gt; line that restricts the container. Your AI agent needs to install tools, write code, manage packages — this restriction causes permission errors everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano Dockerfile &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Find &lt;code&gt;USER node&lt;/code&gt; near the bottom, comment it out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# USER node &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 11: Build&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose build &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Takes a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 12: Onboarding Wizard&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli onboard &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12a. QuickStart vs Advanced&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pick &lt;strong&gt;QuickStart&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12b. Model&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are multiple options here (Anthropic, Google, etc). I went with &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI (Codex OAuth + API key)&lt;/strong&gt;, then &lt;strong&gt;OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT OAuth)&lt;/strong&gt;. Pick whatever works for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12c. OAuth flow&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wizard shows a URL — open it in your &lt;strong&gt;laptop browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Log in to ChatGPT/OpenAI, approve&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Browser redirects to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:xxxx/auth/callback?code=...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Page shows &amp;quot;Unable to connect&amp;quot; — &lt;strong&gt;this is normal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Copy the &lt;strong&gt;entire URL&lt;/strong&gt; from your browser address bar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paste it back into the terminal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12d. Channels&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Select &lt;strong&gt;Telegram&lt;/strong&gt; if you want it (enter bot token from BotFather on Telegram). Skip skills, hooks, API key prompts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12e. Fix bind value&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep &amp;#39;&amp;quot;bind&amp;quot;&amp;#39; /home/openclaw/.openclaw/openclaw.json &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Must say &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;loopback&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. If it says &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;lan&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, change it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;12f. Fix token mismatch (CRITICAL)&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wizard writes its own gateway token to &lt;code&gt;openclaw.json&lt;/code&gt; — it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; from your &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; token. You must sync them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 -c &amp;quot;import json; c=json.load(open(&amp;#39;/home/openclaw/.openclaw/openclaw.json&amp;#39;)); print(c[&amp;#39;gateway&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;auth&amp;#39;][&amp;#39;token&amp;#39;])&amp;quot; grep OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN /home/openclaw/openclaw/.env &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If different, edit &lt;code&gt;openclaw.json&lt;/code&gt; and replace the token:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano /home/openclaw/.openclaw/openclaw.json &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without this fix: CLI commands fail, subagents can&amp;#39;t spawn, cron jobs break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 13: Configure openclaw.json&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nano /home/openclaw/.openclaw/openclaw.json &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure the gateway section has:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;gateway&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;port&amp;quot;: 18789, &amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;local&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;bind&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;loopback&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;auth&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;token&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;token&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_ENV_FILE&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rateLimit&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;maxAttempts&amp;quot;: 10, &amp;quot;windowMs&amp;quot;: 60000, &amp;quot;lockoutMs&amp;quot;: 300000 } }, &amp;quot;controlUi&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;enabled&amp;quot;: true, &amp;quot;allowInsecureAuth&amp;quot;: false } } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bind: &amp;quot;loopback&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; — only listens on &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;allowInsecureAuth: false&lt;/code&gt; — requires device pairing, don&amp;#39;t set to true&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rateLimit&lt;/code&gt; — 10 failed attempts in 60s = 5 min lockout&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 14: Lock File Permissions&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod 700 /home/openclaw/.openclaw &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without this, the security audit flags it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 15: Launch&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check logs:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should see:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[gateway] listening on ws://127.0.0.1:18789 (PID 7) [gateway] agent model: openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If it says &lt;code&gt;ws://0.0.0.0:18789&lt;/code&gt;, your bind is wrong. Fix &lt;code&gt;openclaw.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ctrl+C&lt;/code&gt; to exit logs (gateway keeps running).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 16: Access the Web UI&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;16a. SSH tunnel&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;On your &lt;strong&gt;laptop&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 openclaw@YOUR_VPS_IP &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looks like it hangs. Normal — tunnel is running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;16b. Open the UI&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;In your browser:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:18789/?token=YOUR_FULL_GATEWAY_TOKEN &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Browser does a device pairing handshake. Through the SSH tunnel, gateway sees &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and pairing works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you get &amp;quot;pairing required&amp;quot;, check pending devices and approve yours:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js devices list docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js pairing approve YOUR_DEVICE_ID &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 17: Telegram&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h1&gt;17a. Message your bot&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Send any message on Telegram. It replies with a pairing code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;17b. Approve&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js pairing approve telegram YOUR_PAIRING_CODE &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;17c. Test&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Send another message. Your OpenClaw instance should reply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Step 18: Verify Security&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js security audit --deep &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Should say: &lt;strong&gt;Summary: 0 critical.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check ports:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ss -ltnup | grep -E &amp;#39;18789|18790|:22&amp;#39; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Port 18789 → &lt;a href=&quot;http://127.0.0.1&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only ✅&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Port 22 → &lt;a href=&quot;http://0.0.0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (SSH, only public port)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Port 18790 → should not appear&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Commands Cheat Sheet&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Logs / Restart / Stop / Start docker compose logs -f openclaw-gateway docker compose restart openclaw-gateway docker compose down docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway # Rebuild docker compose build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway # Setup docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli onboard docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli configure docker compose run --rm openclaw-cli doctor # Security docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js security audit --deep docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js status docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js devices list # Telegram docker compose exec openclaw-gateway node dist/index.js pairing approve telegram CODE # SSH tunnel (laptop) ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 openclaw@YOUR_VPS_IP # Config nano /home/openclaw/.openclaw/openclaw.json # Ports ss -ltnup | grep -E &amp;#39;18789|18790|:22&amp;#39; # Update cd openclaw &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker compose build &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker compose up -d openclaw-gateway &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h1&gt;What&amp;#39;s Next&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once running, OpenClaw has more:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenAI-compatible API&lt;/strong&gt; — make API calls to your instance from your own code&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-agent routing&lt;/strong&gt; — separate agents with isolated workspaces&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser tool&lt;/strong&gt; — headless Chromium&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cron jobs&lt;/strong&gt; — scheduled tasks&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heartbeat&lt;/strong&gt; — agent checks in every 30 min&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Webhooks&lt;/strong&gt; — trigger from GitHub, email, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Session resets&lt;/strong&gt; — auto-reset stale conversations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model failover&lt;/strong&gt; — switch models if primary goes down&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Might write about those separately.

was it speed, cost, or that moment you could not explain your own data to a stranger?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Majestic_Side_8488&quot;&gt; /u/Majestic_Side_8488 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9v5m1/my_lovable_app_just_coughed_up_502s_during_the/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9v5m1/my_lovable_app_just_coughed_up_502s_during_the/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9v5m1/my_lovable_app_just_coughed_up_502s_during_the/","author":"/u/Majestic_Side_8488","matchedKeywords":["stripe","checkout","export","technical debt"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":4,"export_quality_shock":6},"totalScore":10,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about my lovable app just coughed up 502s during the investor demo and i still dont know why.

(I&amp;#39;m definitely missing something!)&lt;br/&gt; Is it better to buy a cheap VPS and host them there?

{"draftId":"90056019-7f25-4151-a4fc-578cb323ac04","pillar":"lovable","feedId":"r_lovable","subreddit":"lovable","title":"The &quot;your app works but your code is a mess&quot; checklist I run on every Lovable app before scaling","content":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior software engineer, I&amp;#39;ve audited 100+ vibe coded projects so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that kept coming up in those conversations was founders saying &amp;quot;I think my app is ready to scale, but I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s broken under the hood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I figured I&amp;#39;d share the actual checklist I run when I first look at a Lovable app that has users or is about to start spending on growth. This isn&amp;#39;t about rewriting your app. It&amp;#39;s about finding the 5 or 6 things that are most likely to hurt you and fixing them before they become expensive problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;The health check&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Is your app talking to the database efficiently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the number one performance killer I see in AI-generated code. The AI tends to make separate database calls inside loops instead of batching them. Your app might feel fast with 10 users. At 100 users it slows down. At 500 it starts timing out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What to look for: if your app loads a page and you can see it making dozens of small database requests instead of a few larger ones, that&amp;#39;s the problem. This is sometimes called the &amp;quot;N+1 query problem&amp;quot; if you want to Google it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fix is usually straightforward. Batch your queries. Load related data together instead of one at a time. This alone can make your app 5 to 10 times faster without changing anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Are your API keys and secrets actually secure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still see apps where API keys are hardcoded directly in the frontend code. That means anyone who opens their browser&amp;#39;s developer tools can see your Stripe key, your OpenAI key, whatever you&amp;#39;ve got in there. That&amp;#39;s not a minor issue. Someone could run up thousands of dollars on your OpenAI account or worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What to check: open your app in a browser, right-click, hit &amp;quot;View Page Source&amp;quot; or check the Network tab. If you can see any API keys in there, they need to move to your backend immediately. Your frontend should never talk directly to third-party APIs. It should go through your own backend which keeps the keys hidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re on Lovable, use Lovable Secrets for your environment variables. If you&amp;#39;ve migrated to Railway or another host, use their environment variable settings. Never commit keys to your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. What happens when something fails?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try this: turn off your Wifi and use your app. Or open it in an incognito window and try to access a page that requires login. What happens?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most AI-generated apps, the answer is nothing good. You get a blank screen, a cryptic error, or the app just hangs. Your users are seeing this too. They just aren&amp;#39;t telling you about it. They&amp;#39;re leaving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good error handling means: if a payment fails, the user sees a clear message and can retry. If the server is slow, there&amp;#39;s a loading state instead of a frozen screen. If someone&amp;#39;s session expires, they get redirected to login instead of seeing broken data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#39;t need to be perfect. But the critical flows, signup, login, payment, and whatever your core feature is, should fail gracefully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Do you have any test coverage on your payment flow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your app charges money, this is non-negotiable. I&amp;#39;ve worked with founders who didn&amp;#39;t realize their Stripe integration was silently failing for days. Revenue was leaking and they had no idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At minimum you want: a test that confirms a user can complete a purchase end to end, a test that confirms failed payments are handled properly, and a test that confirms webhooks from Stripe are being received and processed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re not sure how to write these, even a manual checklist that you run through before every deployment helps. Go to your staging environment (you have one, right?), make a test purchase with Stripe&amp;#39;s test card, and confirm everything works. Every single time before you push to production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Is there any separation between your staging and production environments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re pushing code changes directly to the app your customers are using, you&amp;#39;re one bad commit away from breaking everything. I covered this in detail in my last post about the MVP to production workflow, but it&amp;#39;s worth repeating because it&amp;#39;s still the most common gap I see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staging doesn&amp;#39;t need to be complicated. It&amp;#39;s just a second copy of your app that runs your new code before real users see it. Railway makes this easy. Vercel makes this easy. Even a second Lovable deployment can work in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point is: never let your customers be the first people to test your changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Can your app handle 10x your current users?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to over-engineer for millions of users. But you should know what breaks first when traffic increases. Usually it&amp;#39;s the database queries (see point 1), large file uploads with no size limits, or API rate limits you haven&amp;#39;t accounted for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A simple way to think about it: if your app has 50 users right now and someone shares it on Twitter tomorrow and 500 people sign up, what breaks? If you don&amp;#39;t know the answer, that&amp;#39;s the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;What I&amp;#39;d actually prioritize&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking at this list and feeling overwhelmed, don&amp;#39;t try to fix everything at once. Here&amp;#39;s the order I&amp;#39;d tackle it in:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, secure your API keys. This is a safety issue, not a performance issue. Do it today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, set up staging if you don&amp;#39;t have one. This protects you from yourself going forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third, add error handling to your payment flow and test it manually before every deploy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth, fix your database queries if your app is starting to feel slow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fifth and sixth can wait until you&amp;#39;re actively scaling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of these fixes take a few hours each, not weeks. And they&amp;#39;re the difference between an app that can grow and an app that falls apart the moment it starts getting attention. You can even use services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://getvibecodingcoach.com/&quot;&gt;Vibe Coach&lt;/a&gt; or hire a software engineer on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upwork.com/&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt; to do it for you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still on Lovable and not planning to migrate, most of this still applies. The principles are the same regardless of where your app lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me know if you need any help. If you&amp;#39;ve already gone through some of this, I&amp;#39;d genuinely be curious to hear what you found in your own codebase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ebb_and_flow33&quot;&gt; /u/ebb_and_flow33 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9e0q5/the_your_app_works_but_your_code_is_a_mess/","author":"/u/ebb_and_flow33","matchedKeywords":["stripe","webhook","environment variables"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about The &quot;your app works but your code is a mess&quot; checklist I run on every Lovable app before scaling.

It’s grown into a pretty complex product, with multiple systems, integrations, subscriptions, and workflows. The codebase now sits at over 2 million lines generated through the platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not a traditional developer. I didn’t come from a computer science background. Lovable allowed me to turn an idea into something real, and I’ve poured an enormous amount of time into learning, iterating, breaking things, fixing them, and slowly making it work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently I met with a developer because I wanted advice about scaling and doing things properly long term. The conversation kind of threw me off. He kept saying things like “Lovable can’t replace engineers,” which I actually agree with. That was never my expectation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the tone felt dismissive, almost like the work didn’t really count because it was built with AI tools. He asked a lot about revenue and investors, and when I said the platform is subscription based and currently funded by myself, with some help from my dad, the energy shifted. It felt like I had failed some unspoken test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What confused me is that another developer I spoke to afterwards had the complete opposite reaction. He was genuinely impressed that something this complex could be built using Lovable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now I’m curious:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do reactions to Lovable vary so much among developers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it skepticism about maintainability? Concern about technical debt? General resistance to AI assisted development? Or am I just misreading the situation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to replace engineers. I fully expect I will need experienced developers as the product grows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think I just walked away from that meeting feeling strangely discouraged after months of hard work, like building something real didn’t carry the same weight because of how it was built.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear how others here have experienced this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ConfidentWelcome9282&quot;&gt; /u/ConfidentWelcome9282 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9o6wu/built_a_complex_platform_with_lovable_and_left_a/","author":"/u/ConfidentWelcome9282","matchedKeywords":["subscription","technical debt"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":2,"export_quality_shock":3},"totalScore":5,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Built a complex platform with Lovable and left a developer meeting feeling discouraged.

Looking for a little advice on if this is something I could do in Lovable with minimal &amp;quot;try to add something, break 3 other things&amp;quot; instances or if I should be looking at another platform or hiring someone. Years ago I had looked at upwork and fiverr etc and been quoted $10-15k&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Im looking at building a web portal where customers purchase digital streaming assets through Shopify. These are media file URLs that users paste into OBS or other livestreaming platforms as “Internet Media Sources. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a purchase, users should log into the account portion of my site and see a gallery of only the products they own. Each product contains 3 to10 media links that rotate every couple of weeks to reduce piracy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I need user authentication, Shopify purchase syncing, link rotation logic, and an admin panel to manage products and users. I’m trying to determine if Lovable can handle this (possibly with Supabase or Make), or if I need a different architecture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Months ago I tested lovable for this and it was fun creating a simple UX for it but at that point there was no shopify syncing. Now that Shopify has an integration, I am hoping I can get this moving. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have VERY little actual programming knowledge but I am technical and can learn quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I currently have a successful shopify store doing this but I want to upgrade my product to the 2.0 version ive been dreaming of. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;User Purchase Product A with their email address at checkout.&lt;br/&gt; They then create an account on the lovable website using the same email address&lt;br/&gt; They login, hit &amp;quot;my products&amp;quot; and see Product A&lt;br/&gt; They click Product A and a window pops up with the links they need to copy and paste&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/epicoptimist&quot;&gt; /u/epicoptimist &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lovable/comments/1r9jcx5/looking_for_advice_on_feasibility_of_my_project/","author":"/u/epicoptimist","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","checkout"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about Looking for advice on feasibility of my project.

I built it after using Supabase extensively, because I kept running into certain limitations or tedious setups (especially around permissions, storage, and integrations). Nuvix is an open-source, self-hostable backend (think auth, database, storage, messaging all in one API). I’m not here to hype it, just to share how it works under the hood and see if these ideas would address any pain points you’ve had with Supabase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Permissions and Database Schemas&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase is essentially a hosted PostgreSQL with RLS. You get a single Postgres schema (by default &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;) and you enable Row-Level Security (RLS) policies manually on your tables if you need security. In practice that means &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; write SQL policies (e.g. &lt;code&gt;ALTER TABLE … ENABLE RLS; CREATE POLICY … USING (...)&lt;/code&gt;) to control who can see what. Nuvix takes a different approach: it has &lt;strong&gt;three schema modes&lt;/strong&gt; so you can pick how strict or flexible you want to be. Concretely, Nuvix has:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document&lt;/strong&gt; – for rapid prototyping (Appwrite-like): a NoSQL-style table where you don’t write SQL and permissions are manual.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managed&lt;/strong&gt; – for production apps: tables are auto-generated with CRUD endpoints, and Nuvix auto-creates RLS policies and permission tables (so the data is “secure by default”).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unmanaged&lt;/strong&gt; – full SQL power: you define your own tables/views and write raw Postgres queries, with no built-in restrictions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;These share one unified API. The key is “secure by default”: every request (db query, file action, etc.) goes through Nuvix’s permission checks. In Supabase, the default is more relaxed (you have to turn on RLS per table and write the policies yourself). In Nuvix, I’ve tried to bake in a zero-trust model (managed schemas auto-enable RLS so you don’t forget). Of course Supabase is more mature here – its RLS system is powerful and flexible once you know SQL, and you can disable it on a table if you need a quick hack. Nuvix trades some of that raw flexibility for easier, safer defaults when you need them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Storage and Uploads&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase storage is S3-compatible buckets with a separate API client. By default you get a bucket where anyone with a signed URL can upload/download, and you manage bucket-level policies. Large uploads (&amp;gt;6MB) require using Supabase’s &lt;strong&gt;Resumable/TUS&lt;/strong&gt; protocol client. In other words, for big files you often end up using a library like &lt;code&gt;tus-js-client&lt;/code&gt; and hitting a special resumable endpoint. It works fine, but it’s a bit indirect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuvix’s storage is more tightly integrated with the database permissions. Under the hood you can plug in S3 or even local disk, but every file has the same RLS-like rules as your data (so a user only accesses files they’re allowed to). The Nuvix SDK also has &lt;strong&gt;chunked/resumable uploads built in&lt;/strong&gt; – you don’t need a separate TUS client or to manage multipart manually (the SDK handles splitting and retry). In practice it means I can do &lt;code&gt;nuvix.uploadFile(...)&lt;/code&gt; on a big file and get progress callbacks, and the server stitches the pieces together. Supabase can do similar things with TUS (6MB chunks by default), but Nuvix tries to make it seamless out of the box.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The storage philosophies differ: Supabase leans on S3 and a straightforward REST bucket model (you can also generate signed URLs to bypass Supabase altogether). Nuvix treats the file store as a “permission-aware file system” – essentially an API layer on top of S3/local that checks RLS rules. The trade-off is complexity vs convenience: Supabase’s way is simpler (and battle-tested at scale), whereas Nuvix’s way aims for uniform security (but is newer code).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Messaging and Integrations&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;One big gap I felt in Supabase was messaging. Supabase provides email for user auth out-of-the-box (via GoTrue), but if you want SMS, push notifications, or anything fancy, you have to connect external services yourself. For example, many people wire up OneSignal or Firebase in an Edge Function to send push/SMS/email when a DB event happens. That’s flexible, but it’s extra work per channel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuvix decided to include messaging APIs natively. You can send &lt;strong&gt;email, SMS, or push&lt;/strong&gt; through one simple interface. We have templates and scheduling baked in so you can do things like “send verification SMS” without wiring Twilio or a separate mail server (you still need your own Twilio/SendGrid keys configured, but Nuvix handles the rest). The upside is convenience: one API call covers multiple channels. The downside is that Nuvix’s integrations are fewer today – you’re tied to whatever providers we support (Twilio, SendGrid, etc.) in the Nuvix config. Supabase’s model is more DIY but infinitely flexible (you can use any service via edge functions).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;SDK and Developer Experience&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase’s JavaScript client (&lt;code&gt;@supabase/supabase-js&lt;/code&gt;) is great and strongly typed, but it still feels like a thin veneer over multiple services (supabase.auth.goTrue, supabase.from(table), supabase.storage.from(bucket), etc.). Nuvix exposes a single &lt;code&gt;Client&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code&gt;const nx = new Client({projectId, endpoint})&lt;/code&gt;) and everything (auth, db, storage, messaging) lives on that object with consistent naming. We focused on making the APIs &lt;strong&gt;type-safe and discoverable&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, fetching data, uploading a file, and sending an email use similar patterns and all benefit from autocompletion. We don’t offer GraphQL yet, so it’s REST/JSON only (though we support nested filters and joins in clever ways, aiming to be easier than raw PostgREST).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the hood, Supabase uses PostgREST for the DB, Kong/gotrue for auth, and so on, whereas Nuvix is one Node/Bun service with an integrated metadata layer (we build the API endpoints ourselves). Supabase’s SDK also has built-in real-time subscriptions (via Realtime or Postgres listen), which Nuvix doesn’t have yet. We trade some of that maturity for a unified model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hosting and Flexibility&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase’s main draw is the hosted experience: you can sign up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://supabase.com&quot;&gt;supabase.com&lt;/a&gt; and get a DB+auth+storage without setup. They also offer a Docker-based self-host if you want control. Nuvix is built to be &lt;strong&gt;self-hosted first&lt;/strong&gt;: we ship a Docker Compose that you can run anywhere, and your data lives wherever you choose. It’s also multi-tenant: one Nuvix server can host multiple projects (each with its own schema isolation), whereas Supabase is typically “one database per project.” For a SaaS builder, that means fewer servers/dbs to manage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trade-off: Supabase’s hosting is polished and scalable (and supports a multi-region edge network, etc.), while Nuvix gives you complete ownership and easy on-prem deployment. Supabase has the edge on enterprise readiness (performance scaling, analytics, native GraphQL, vector search), but Nuvix prioritizes giving you direct control and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Where Supabase Excels (and Nuvix is New)&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supabase is a mature ecosystem. It has a polished dashboard, a ton of examples, and features like auto-generated GraphQL, Edge Functions, and vector DBs. If you hit a common problem, there’s likely a guide or NPM package for it. Nuvix is brand new (just hit 1.0). It doesn’t have all those extensions yet, and the community is small. Supabase’s approach is also a bit more incremental (add what you need, skip what you don’t) while Nuvix tries to do “everything in one place.” That means some opinions baked in, which may not fit every use-case out of the box.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Where Nuvix Takes a Different Path&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Nuvix I tried to solve pain points I had with Supabase. One was the repetitive work of setting up RLS everywhere – Nuvix makes security the default . Another was the friction of multiple services (auth here, storage there, messaging over there) – Nuvix provides one coherent stack (e.g. one SDK, one dashboard). The three-schema model was designed to support both rapid NoSQL-style development and structured relational workflows, depending on the use case. I also built chunked upload and unified permissions in the core so you don’t have to wire those in manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obviously Nuvix is opinionated and has less polish (and fewer community integrations) right now. But I wanted to spark a discussion about whether these trade-offs are worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really curious:&lt;/strong&gt; for all of you who’ve built stuff on Supabase, have you hit problems that any of these design choices would solve? Would auto-RLS schemas, built-in chunked uploads, and a single messaging API make your life easier, or would you prefer the flexibility Supabase currently offers? I’d love honest feedback from the Supabase community, not as a pitch but as a genuine question about developer trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Mail-587&quot;&gt; /u/Illustrious-Mail-587 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8ulqz/i_built_nuvix_after_using_supabase_for_a_while/","author":"/u/Illustrious-Mail-587","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","subscription","schema"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":8},"totalScore":8,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about I built Nuvix after using Supabase for a while.

Thanks for input!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started my project with Supabase a few years ago with a web app and a backend service (Next.js route handlers, functions). I leaned heavily on RLS and input validation via triggers as recommended by Supabase, but struggled with some practical aspects:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sometimes a user should see an aggregation (e.g. sum, average), but not the actual rows. So I ended up with overly permissive policies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I use TypeScript libs for complex schema validation in the browser and in the backend, but I&amp;#39;d need to re-implement these rules via SQL. So I skipped that and settled for some basic rules.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;PL/pgSQL is very cumbersome when it comes to implementing and maintaining complex logic in a modular way, especially compared to modern languages like TypeScript.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this permissive approach, any authenticated user could bypass the backend entirely and read/write the database directly, skipping backend-defined schema checks and visibility rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fix: a RESTRICTIVE RLS policy on every table that requires a server-side API key. The key lives in Vault. Only our backend service sends it, browsers don&amp;#39;t know it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql CREATE FUNCTION rbac.is_server_request() RETURNS boolean LANGUAGE sql STABLE SECURITY DEFINER AS $$ SELECT coalesce( current_setting(&amp;#39;request.headers&amp;#39;, true)::json-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;#39;x-api-key&amp;#39; = (SELECT decrypted_secret FROM vault.decrypted_secrets WHERE name = &amp;#39;postgrest_api_key&amp;#39;), false); $$; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql -- Added to every public table CREATE POLICY &amp;quot;Require server request&amp;quot; ON my_table AS RESTRICTIVE FOR ALL USING (rbac.is_server_request()); &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because RESTRICTIVE policies are AND-ed with PERMISSIVE ones, no request gets through without the key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A pgTAP test in CI catches any new table missing the policy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sql SELECT is( (SELECT array_agg(t.tablename) FROM pg_tables t WHERE t.schemaname = &amp;#39;public&amp;#39; AND t.rowsecurity = true AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM pg_policies p WHERE p.tablename = t.tablename AND p.policyname = &amp;#39;Require server request&amp;#39; AND p.permissive = &amp;#39;RESTRICTIVE&amp;#39;)), NULL, &amp;#39;All tables must have the restrictive server request policy&amp;#39;); &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your feedback -- especially if you know a simpler way to achieve this or if you see a flaw in this approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Estimate-362&quot;&gt; /u/No-Estimate-362 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/comments/1r8v3yx/how_to_prevent_clientside_access_to_postgrest_api/","author":"/u/No-Estimate-362","matchedKeywords":["supabase","rls","schema"],"scoreBreakdown":{"payments_and_backend":6},"totalScore":6,"suggestedReply":"Saw your post about How to prevent client-side access to PostgREST API.

This update is probably most relevant for the devs in the crowd, so if you’re already familiar with agents, scroll down a bit. But if you’re unfamiliar with agents: agents are AI-powered programs that can make decisions and execute actions autonomously. They can run a deep research query or build an entire application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that out of the way, here’s the meatier info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we’re launching a preview of machine payments on Stripe. This will allow developers to directly charge autonomous agents using just a few lines of code. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Autonomous agents, being an entirely new category of users to build for and sell to, are acting on behalf of buyers in a financial system that is not set up for them. They require:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;microtransactions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;24/7 global rails&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;controls (for human out of the loop)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;low latency&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;http native&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;finality guarantees &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with this update, businesses can accept machine payments via Stripe PaymentIntents API. They can charge agents for API usage, MCP calls, or HTTP requests with agent-specific pricing plans, in addition to conventional monetization using subscriptions and invoices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flow:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a PaymentIntent&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stripe generates a unique deposit address per transaction&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Return the address to the agent and instruct it to send funds or a payment token&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Track transaction status via API, webhook, or Dashboard&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Money lands in your default balance&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re launching with support for x402 using USDC stablecoins on Base, with more protocols, payment methods, currencies, and chains to come. And sales tax, refunds, and reporting just work.
