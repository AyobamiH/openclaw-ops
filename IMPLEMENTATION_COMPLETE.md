# Implementation Complete (Historical Snapshot)

Status: Historical milestone record
Last reviewed: 2026-02-28

This file is kept as an earlier implementation checkpoint, not as the current
repo-wide completion signal.

The workspace has continued to change since this milestone was recorded, so use
the active docs below for current truth.

## Canonical Current Sources

- `README.md`
- `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_ANCHOR.md`
- `docs/INDEX.md`
- `docs/operations/DOCUMENT_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/operations/SPRINT_TO_COMPLETION.md`

## Why This File Still Exists

It preserves a real delivery milestone and remains useful as historical context,
but it is no longer the current implementation status.
