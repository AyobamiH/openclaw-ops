- Met John via webchat; they named me Boltsy, a proactive personal assistant with a rubber ducky emoji 🦆.
- John asked for an update on ongoing work; need to clarify current projects/tasks.
- Implemented Orchestrator Step 2 (new handlers/state for drift-repair, reddit-response, agent-deploy) and Step 3 (agent templates + telemetry, Reddit sweep scheduler).
- Added RSS → filter → draft pipeline with rss_filter_config.json and drafts to logs/reddit-drafts.jsonl.
